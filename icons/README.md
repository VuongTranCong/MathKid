# MathKid App Icons

This directory contains the app icons for the MathKid PWA. In a production implementation, these would be actual PNG image files.

## Required Icon Sizes

- **icon-72x72.png** - Android small icon
- **icon-96x96.png** - Android medium icon
- **icon-128x128.png** - Chrome Web Store icon
- **icon-144x144.png** - Android large icon
- **icon-152x152.png** - iPad icon
- **icon-192x192.png** - Android extra large icon (maskable)
- **icon-512x512.png** - High-resolution icon (maskable)

## Icon Design Guidelines

For the MathKid app, the icons should feature:

1. **Color Scheme**: Primary green (#4CAF50) with colorful accents
2. **Elements**:
   - Math symbols (+ - × ÷)
   - Calculator or number elements
   - Kid-friendly design with rounded corners
   - Bright, engaging colors
3. **Style**:
   - Flat design with subtle shadows
   - Clear visibility at small sizes
   - Consistent branding across all sizes
4. **Maskable Icons**: 192x192 and 512x512 should be maskable with safe area considerations

## Creating the Icons

To create these icons for production:

1. Design a 512x512 master icon in a graphics editor
2. Export at different sizes maintaining clarity
3. Test visibility at small sizes (72x72)
4. Ensure maskable versions work with different shapes
5. Optimize file sizes for faster loading

## Placeholder Implementation

For this demo, placeholder files should be created. In a real app, you would replace these with actual professionally designed icons that follow the app's branding and design system.
